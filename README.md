- Integrated FReshwAter Microbial GenoME Catalog (iFRAME) is a new repository of freshwater microbial genomes compiled from the biomining of public genomic repositories. iFRAME catalog is composed of 2,855 species-level genome bins (SGBs), comprising isolates and uncultivated metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) from different parts of the Earth. The iFRAME repository will be a useful resource to explore new biotechnological enzymes and functional processes of cultivated and uncultivated species in future studies.
